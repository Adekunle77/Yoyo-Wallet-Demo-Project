# Yoyo Wallet Demo Project
 iOS Code Challenge - Junior Engineer -  Take Home Test

## Development

### App Logic

After reading the code challenge documentation, my first objective was to develop the logic side of the app. I started with developing the app’s API request. I always feel this is where I should begin, when developing an app that require’s data from an API.

After I created the opening view. I use MVVM design pattern for the Opening View. I chose this design pattern because I find it helpful to separate the logic part of the app from the ViewContonller

### Tests 

I created Unit Tests for the ModelView (OpeningViewModel). I would have like to developed more tests, as I understand the importance of it.  

### Bugs 

I found that there is some errors in the data retrieved from the API request. Some HTML attributes can be seem in the String part of the text. I tried to find a way to remove them. 

### Final Thought 

If I had to develop this app again, I feel that I would have try to include the search parameters. I feel this is a feature that would have shown my knowledge on data structure. 

I did not want to use any libraries. As a junior developer, learning my trade, I feel that it is important to understand the basics, and know what is going on under the hood. I believe doing this, will help me as a developer, have a good understanding of the iOS frameworks, andknow how to use libraries better.
